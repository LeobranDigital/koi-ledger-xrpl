## Core MVP Features – KOI LEDGER

**Goal:** Showcase the digital passport, ownership, and verification flow for premium Koi (Nishikigoi) using XRPL.

### 1. Dashboard / Home Screen

* List all registered Koi with thumbnails (start with 2–3 sample Koi).
* Quick search by name or Koi ID.

### 2. Koi Detail View

* Display full digital passport: lineage, photo, breeder info, and health records.
* Show XRPL transaction hash for verification.
* `Verify Ownership` button → confirms record on the ledger.

### 3. Register New Koi

* Form to input breeder, lineage, color pattern, and initial owner.
* Submission triggers XRPL transaction storing metadata.

### 4. Transfer Ownership

* Select a Koi → input new owner → submit transaction.
* Updates ownership history and shows ledger confirmation.

### 5. Health Log Update

* Add timestamped vaccinations or treatment records.
* Optional QR code linking to the tank / Koi tag for easy verification.

### Demo Flow

1. Register a Koi → show XRPL transaction hash.
2. Transfer ownership → update history.
3. Verify Koi authenticity → lookup on public ledger.
4. Update health record → show audit trail.

**✅ Notes on Realistic Scope for Phase 2:**

* Start with **2–3 sample Koi** for demonstration.
* Each action touches **XRPL ledger** to highlight auditability and transparency.
* Focus on **storytelling + proof of blockchain integration**, not full production features.
* Stretch features (bulk registration, marketplace view, or full QR linking) can be added post-competition.
